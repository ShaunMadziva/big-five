🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I archived all of the main requirements and some of the stretch goals (button hover, smooth scrolling & social media links in footer). Unfortunatley I didn't have enough time to do the rest of the stretch goals, but I'll try again later. 

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

I don't think so.

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

I ran into a git issue but I was able to find the solution:
